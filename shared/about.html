  <p> The VLF Observatory Network (vlfnet) is a peer-to-peer network of VLF receiver stations
  that are able to receive simulateously on the VLF band allowing to build a large interferometer
  for signals on this band by measureing the phase-shift of a signal simultaneously received by the
  stations of the network. </p>

  <p> Each station publishes a list of all other stations known. This allows to discover new
  stations easily. </p>

  <p> Additionally, each station in the network publishes its reception schedule. This allows other
  staions to synchronisze, increasing the likelihood that a sufficient large number of stations are
  receiving the same singals simultaneously. </p>
